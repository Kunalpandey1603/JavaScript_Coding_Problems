// Solution of problem - 1


/* Variable a:
So in someFunction when p1 is changed it does not affect a variable as we just passed the value to p1
 not the actual reference to a.

Variable b:
In someFunction, we passed the reference of b to p2 and when p2 is assigned a new array, 
it is removing the reference for b and created new reference for value ['1','2','3'] and assigned that to p2. 
Hence b is unchanged.

Variable c:
In someFunction, we passed the reference of c to p3 and when we push new items to p3 we are adding the new item to the same reference. Hence we are chaning both c and p3 as they both point to same memory reference.
Note: push method is a mutating method. */

var display = function () {

/* When ever a script loads, a global execution context is created and it has 2 phases: creation and execution phase.
 Variable hoisting takes place during creation phase. It is during this phase all the varibles in the current execution
  context are declared and no value is assiged to these variables until they are executed.
So when question 2 is loaded in js runtime before it executes the script js runtime creates a global execution context
 and creates variables "number" and "display" (this is called hoisting). 
 At this point those variables are empty(undefined).
Then the script(question 2) execution starts then the following happens:
line 1: variable number is assigned with value 10.
line 3-6: variable display is assigned with function definition (skips the execution of function).
line 8: when "display" function is called, function exection context is created and before running the function 
a local number variable is created and the value is undefined. Now the execution jumps to line .
line 4: when we log number js runtime first looks for number in current execution context and prints it.
 At this point in function execution context we have a variable number but no value is assigned yet, 
 hence it prints undefined.
line 5: Here we are assiging the variable number value 2. */

// Problem 4 

// Pass-By-Reference:

let john = {
  name: "John Smith",
  age: 45,
  gender: "male",
};

let newJohn = john; 
newJohn.name= 'Kunal Pandey'
console.log("john", john);
console.log("newJohn", newJohn);

// john { name: 'Kunal Pandey', age: 45, gender: 'male' }
// newJohn { name: 'Kunal Pandey', age: 45, gender: 'male' }

// Remember when I said that instead of making a copy, a value in memory will be referenced?
// The newJohn object is NOT a copy of the object stored inside of the john variable. Instead, the variable newJohn 
// is referencing the original john object.

// That means if you decide to edit thenewJohn object
// ( e.g changing the name property of newJohn on line 3 to "Kunal Pandey"), you are in fact modifying the john object!

// As you can see in lines 16 and 19, both objectsâ€™ name property has a value of "Kunal Pandey".

// Problem 5

The log() function captures the value of the variable i during each iteration. 
Then setTimout() schedules an execution of log(). When for() cycle completes, i variable has value 3.
The 3 scheduled log() callbacks are called by setTimeout().
 log() reads the current value of variable i, which is 3 and logs as 3. */
